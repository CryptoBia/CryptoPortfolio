# Translate
It would be nice, if you can help me to translate this program. Here is how to do it:

1. Open translations.js
2. Add a translation for each item. Add brackets just like in the other translated sentences.
3. Open main.js and add the abbreviation of the added language to the end of the "languages" array (e.g. "es"). This array can currently be found in line 77.
4. Open index.html and add an option with the language that you added, eg. `<option value="es">es</option>`. This code can currently be found in line 42.
5. Save both files and start a Pull Request.

# Translate
It would be nice, if you can help me to translate this program. Here is how to do it:

1. Open [translations.js][1] and add a translation for each item. Add brackets just like in the other translated sentences.
2. Open [main.js][2] and add the abbreviation of the added language to the end of the "languages" array (e.g. "es"). This array can currently be found in line 77.
3. Open [index.html][3] and add an option with the language that you added, eg. `<option value="es">es</option>`. This code can currently be found in line 42.
4. Save both files and start a Pull Request.
5. Get a big kiss from the maintainer.
